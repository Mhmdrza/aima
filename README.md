AIMA - Artificial Intelligence, A Maker's Approach
==================================================

The AIMA project develops open-source software for Artificial
Intelligence.

The AIMA software toolkit is a framework that facilitates the 
creation and evaluation of bespoke Artificial Intelligence (AI)
functions. It is designed to be flexible and adaptable, covering the
whole spectrum of required tasks from feature engineering to machine
learning.


Mission
-------
To provide an open-source implementation of Russell and Norvig's
"Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach" book as the main 
reference guide (hence the name of the project).


Features
--------
All algorithms described in the book (planned).


Requirements
------------
Lua 5.2


Development status
------------------
See TODO, CHANGES and ChangeLog.


Bug tracking
------------
See FIXME.


Developer guidelines
--------------------
See INSTALL and HACKING.


Documentation
-------------
Embedded in the code. Use "help" command. FAQ, website and mailing list
may be created if many users/developers join the project.

In the meantime, for any comment or suggestion of any kind, please
